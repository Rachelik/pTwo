Project 2 (NOTbook) Pre-Project-Exercise
Rachel Ik

Persona
People who work and study, constantly taking Notes.
Sometimes, too busy and lose it all.

Concept Design
- Problem statement/Pain points
Keeping notes in an organised way for avid note takers.
Take care of work or learning at the same time.
Work is to keep track of meetings, deadline, meeting minutes and follow-up.
Study is to take notes of course, schedule, deadline, notes and progress.
Donâ€™t always have notebook around but handphone is always there.
IMPORTANT stuff to remember. Just in case you forget.
- Solution
App to make these records.
Ability to recall by their title or keyword or date. Colour coded.
Save paper that goes missing or not available when needed outside of work.

User Stories
-I want to create a list of important notes for this course/book/article/idea/work/etc.
-I want to be able to search for it by their title (segregate by title/category).
-I want to be able to review the important points.
-I want to be able to bookmark the notes for review/revision later.

Feature lacking
- Search bar
- Bookmarked list
  Highlighted list should get random 3 instead but it listed all current highlights.

  ## Project Post Mortem
  Post mortems are important to understand about what happened in a project and actively think about what you learned.

  Post-mortems are meant to be a blame-less space open to objective conversation about what went well and what could be improved.

  Even in the examples below, where tens of millions of dollars could be lost, the best approach is to think through the series of events that led to the outcome.

  Large mistakes are almost never the fault of the developer, but of the sytems and processes in place to prevent errors and problems.

  #### Approach and Process

  1. What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
  -------
  - Plan in details with code that I needed to avoid meeting a dead end.
  - Time management for target per day so to prevent scrapping away code that I have been trying out for days and it doesn't work.
  - Ask earlier with my approaches and probably someone might tell me that it wouldn't work earlier than later. Hope I managed to listen too.
  - Need to consider the errors that I might get.
  - Understand AJAX more before using it. It might clash.
  -------

  2. What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
----------
  - Trying to achieve what I had in mind. It drives me to code.
  - Pseudocode helped me to keep track of data when I have crappy variables.
  - Think of the code and css design together as a whole. The design helped picturing of the state the code is in.
  - console.log()
  - determine the routes first and write out my data expected for each page.
---------

  #### Code and Code Design

  1. What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
  -------
  - HTML is a bit messy. Need distinctive features of each page. Otherwise, it looked all the same.
  - Crazy routes.
  - html jsx being copied and pasted instead of using template. repeated code.
  -------

  2. What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?
  -------
  - Use boolean to get highlights.
  -------

    For each, please include code examples.
    1. Code snippet up to 20 lines.
    2. Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

  #### WDI Unit 2 Post Mortem
  1. What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?
  - console.log to see if everything is working before writing more code.
  - picturing what I wanted.
  - search for solution.
  - notes taking and revising.

  2. What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?
  - Understanding each materials in depth.
  - ask when I am stuck.
  - time management.
  - Don't search too far. Might get distracted. Search enough to get things done.
  - notes taking to recall what I have learnt and do more research.

  3. How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)
  - So far I am still following but I think I need time to revise back what each code truly means.
